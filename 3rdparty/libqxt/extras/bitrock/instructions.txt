subject	RE: BitRock InstallBuilder for Qt

Hi J-P,

Thank you for your interest in BitRock InstallBuilder. We are happy to
provide you with a free license. I am attaching the license, "license.xml"
to this email. First, you need to download the latest version of
InstallBuilder for Qt (Professional edition) from:

http://www.bitrock.com/download_installbuilderqt_download.html

Then, to register the product, you can either copy the file to the BitRock
InstallBuilder installation directory or, from the main application menu,
select 'License', then 'Register license' and follow the on-screen
instructions.

We hope you and your users enjoy BitRock InstallBuilder, and we wish you the
best of luck with your projects. We are attaching an "Installers by BitRock"
icon. Posting it and/or a link to bitrock.com in your download or project
page would be greatly appreciated, although it is not required. We will keep
you informed of InstallBuilder's new features and functionality by sending
you a monthly newsletter. If for any reason you prefer to not receive this,
simply send us an email requesting to be taken off our list.

Please do not hesitate to contact us with feature suggestions or any issues
you may find. We love to hear from our users and your feedback helps us
improve our software.

Best Regards,

Erica
